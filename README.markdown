Eco Zico Application Repository
===============================

This is the repository for Eco Zico--a forthcoming iPad app developed by Donal O'Brien and Brennon Bortz in conjunction with the author of Eco Zico, Olive O'Brien.  If you're not on of these three people and you're here, you probably shouldn't be.

Project Structure
-----------------

* `EcoZico` - The home of the main Xcode project directory.
* `experimental` - For sketching / testing experimental features that may or may not be rolled into the main development.
* `resources` - Images, video, sketches, etc. for use throughout development.

We'll use branching for developing features within the main Xcode project itself (in the `EcoZico` folder), but for testing ideas let's use the experimental folder (trying out *cocos2d*, etc.)
